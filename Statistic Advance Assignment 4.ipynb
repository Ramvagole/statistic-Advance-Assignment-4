    "The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the underlying assumptions about the population and the sample size. Here's a breakdown of each test and an example scenario where you would use them:\n",

    "Assumption: The population follows a normal distribution, but the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "Sample size: Typically used for small sample sizes (less than 30), but it can also be used for larger sample sizes.\n",
    "Example scenario: Let's say you want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores of two groups (e.g., Group A and Group B) on an exam. You collect a sample of 20 students from each group and measure their scores. To compare the means of the two groups, you would use a t-test.\n",

    "\n",
    "Assumption: The population follows a normal distribution, and the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "Sample size: Typically used for large sample sizes (greater than 30) since the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution.\n",
    "Example scenario: Suppose you are conducting a study on the average heights of adult males in a specific city. The historical data shows that the population standard deviation of heights is 2.5 inches. You collect a random sample of 100 adult males and measure their heights. In this case, you have a large enough sample size, and you know the population standard deviation. Therefore, you would use a z-test to determine if the sample mean height differs significantly from the known population mean height.\n",
